          <P id="testP" class="funParagraph"><B>Schnucks (2014) </B> was my first job, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. This, and also because it allowed me to afford to go 
                  to a Beyonc&eacute;  concert! I started it right when I was moving into my freshman dorm at college. I wasn't amazing at this job, but I wasn't terrible. 
                  my manager trusted me to watch over the salad bar unattended, so it taught me to be independent. It also taught me to ask questions,
                  because I had no idea what to do most of the time. At the time i thought this job was very busy, but looking back, it was truly
                  of the slowest and most chill jobs I've ever had, and I'm glad it was.  </P>

             <P><B>Moto Mart (2015) </B> Was my 4th job I've ever had. It really helped me with social skills, and thinking on my feet.
                  90% of customers there will try to scam you, and it taught me to think for myself and be confident. Most customers
                  I had would also talk down to you and make you feel like an idiot. I wasn't a confrontation person until
                  I worked here. I mastered a balance of shutting people down without going too far, and staying professionsl.
                  Being able to demand respect without becoming unprofessional is a key skill that I bring to every single job I've had since.</P>

                <p><B>Qdoba (2016) </B> Is the longest job I've ever had, and I was great at it. It was exhausting but 
                     I got to work with my friends</p>

                   <p><B>C.A.B. (2015) </B> (Campus Activities Board)Is the only job I've been fired from. The main thing I learned
                        from this job resourcefulness & how to combat imposter syndrome. I had imposter syndrome because I was actually
                           an imposter. I was not trained or qualified for this job at all, and everyone knew it. I reached out for help, but 
                              that only did so much. It was an epic fail, but it at least taught me what being an actual 
                           imposter felt like. Any new thing that I feel unprepared for, I always look back on this experience and say, "at 
                           least it's not as bad as CAB." Experiencing this firsthand has done wonders for my confidence in almost everything 
                           I attempt, and I'm glad it happened.</p>
